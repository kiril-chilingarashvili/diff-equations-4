    "### In calculus you would say that the unit step function $u(t)$ is non-differentiable at $t=0$; it's not even continuous there. But we need to talk about its derivative. Here are two examples of how this shows up.\n",

    "### 1. A bank account is modeled by the equation\n",
    "## $$ \\dot{x} - Ix = q(t) $$\n",
    " \n",
    "###    where $I$ is the interest rate, and $q(t)$ is the net rate of deposit. One day you deposit a large amount of money. This total deposit is best modeled by a step function. Thus the deposit rate $q(t)$ is best modeled by the derivative of this step function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Suppose we give a soccer ball a good swift kick. Its velocity increases abruptly from $v=0$ to a positive value $v_0$. The velocity function can be modeled by $v(t) = v_0 u(t)$. What can we say about the force applied by my foot?\n",
    "\n",
    "###    Force is the time rate of change of momentum. Momentum is mass times velocity, so it's given by $m v(t) = m v_0 u(t)$. So the force is the derivative of $m v_0 u(t)$.\n",

    "### While the ideal step function has no derivative, our treatment of the step function lets us deal with its derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### We saw that in reality the unit step function is an idealization of a smooth function that increases in value from 0 to 1 in a very short period of time. Viewed in that light, the derivative of $u(t)$ is easy to picture. Expanding the $t$ axis so we can see how $u(t)$ increases in value from 0 to 1, we get a graph like this:\n",

    "### The derivative $\\dot{u}(t)$ will then have a graph that looks like this:\n",
    "![img](img/s52.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Since $u(t)$ increases in value by 1, the area under the graph of $\\dot{u}(t)$ is 1. It's a very narrow tall spike. The same kind of idealization that we used to replace the smooth function of $u(t)$ with the Heaviside step function leads to the ***Dirac delta function***\n",
    "## $$ \\delta(t) = \\dot{u}(t) $$\n",

    "\n",
    "### ***Conventions***\n",
    "\n",
    "### While you might decide to draw a upwards arrow at $t=1$ with a $-2$ to decorate it indicating a value of $-2$ for the integral, it is more common to draw a downwards pointing arrow, decorated with a positive $2$.\n",

So the graph of $\\delta(t-a)f(t)$ is also a very narrow rectangle that is $f(a)$ times taller than the one for the delta function alone. Hence, the area under $\\delta(t-a)f(t)$ is $f(a)$.\n",
