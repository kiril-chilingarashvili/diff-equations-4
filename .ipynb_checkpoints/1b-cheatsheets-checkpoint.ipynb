    "![img](img/circuit-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The power source at left is the antenna, being driven by radio waves. The resistor at top is a speaker. The other components are a capacitor, at bottom, and an inductance coil, at right.\n",
    "\n",
    "### We will model this circuit using the same five-step process we used for mechanical systems in Lecture 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. ***Draw a diagram of the system***. We've already done Step 1!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. ***Identify and give symbols for the parameters of the system***. The diagram shows symbols for four standard electronic components. The first step in understanding the diagram is to define an orientation; say that current flows clockwise. Since it's a series circuit, the current through any of the wires is the same; write $I(t)$ for it. Then we can say that the power source, at left, produces a voltage ***increase*** of $V(t)$ volts at time $t$. This voltage increase may vary with time, and may be negative as well as positive. In fact we'll be especially interested in the case in which it is sinusoidal!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The meaning of each of the other components is specified by how the voltage decrease across it is related to the current flowing through it. For us, these relationships define the components. The impact of each component is determined by the constant appearing in these relationships.\n",

    "## $$ V = V_L+V_R+V_C $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. ***Declare the input signal and the system response***. The system is being driven by a signal coming in via antenna. This signal causes a voltage difference across the antenna, and it is reasonable to declare this voltage increase $V(t)$ as the input signal. For system response, we are interested in the loudness of the speaker, which is proportional to the voltage drop across the resistor. So we declare $V_R$ to be the system response.\n",
    "### This means that we want to set up a differential equation relating $V(t)$ to $V_R(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. ***Write down a differential equation relating the input signal and the system response, using Newton's “$F=ma$\" in the mechanical case or Kirchhoff's laws in the electrical case***. Because $\\dot{V}_C$ appears in the definition of a capacitor, it is natural to differentiate Kirchhoff's voltage law, and rewrite in terms of $I$;\n",

    "## Bode Plot - Footnotes\n",
    "\n",
    "### ***Why “Bode\"?*** \n",
    "#### Bode plots are named after Hendrick Wade Bode, 1905–1982. Bode (rhymes with toady) was one of the fathers of modern control theory. For most of his career he worked at Bell Labs. During World War II he devised the feedback mechanism linking radar data to anti-aircraft fire. After the war he occupied high administrative positions at Bell Labs. In 1967 he retired as Vice President in charge of military development and systems engineering, and took up the position of Gordon McKay Professor at Harvard, a post he held till 1974.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our use of the phrase “Bode plots\" in this course is inaccurate in several respects. First of all, in engineering applications one typically has to cope with a wide range of frequencies. To represent them, one plots the log of the frequency horizontally. Similarly, the gain often spans a wide range of values, and to provide clear visualizations of the gain it is sensible to plot  rather than . So typically the gain Bode plot uses a log-log scale, as shown below.\n",
    "![img](img/bode.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The vertical logarithmic scale is often measured in “decibels.\" The decibel measure of gain $g$ is $20 \\log_{10} g$ Db. This can also be written $10 \\log_{10} g^2$, which is of interest since the power of a sinusoidal signal is proportional to the square of its amplitude. Use of these units originated at Bell Labs in the 1920's.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The phase Bode plot uses $\\log \\omega$ horizontally, and $-\\phi$ vertically. No need for a log vertically; after all, in a sense $\\phi$ is already a logarithm – in the complex gain it occurs as $e^{-i\\phi}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Even these smooth log-log plots are not quite the thing that Bode introduced. He provided quick and efficient ways to sketch these plots, or piecewise linear approximations of them."

An orange line segment connects the origin to the value $G(\\omega)$ of the complex gain at the selected value of $\\omega$. Set $b=1$ and watch what happens to this vector as you move the $\\omega$ slider. The length of the strut is the magnitude of the complex gain, that is, the gain $g(\\omega)$. You can see it vary with $\\omega$. The argument of the complex gain is the phase lead $-\\phi(\\omega)$. This curve in the complex plane, called the ***Nyquist plot***, displays the relationship between the gain and the phase lag.\n",
