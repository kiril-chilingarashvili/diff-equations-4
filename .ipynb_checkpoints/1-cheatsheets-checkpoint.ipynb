    "## A mass/spring/dashpot system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To gain an appreciation for the kind of question we are discussing, study the Mathlet below. It represents a mass/spring/dashpot system. We are interested in how the orange mass moves. The spring is attached to a wall, and the far end of the dashpot is being moved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In analyzing any system, we have to specify the ***input signal*** and the output signal or system response. Here we declare the position of the dashpot piston to be the input signal $y(t)$, and the position of the mass, $x(t)$, to be the system response. The applet specifies that the input signal is sinusoidal; indeed it is given by $\\cos(\\omega t)$, with amplitude 1 and angular frequency $\\omega$. What you observe is that the motion of the mass, the system response, is ***also sinusoidal***, with the ***same period***. This sinusoidal system response is the \"steady state response.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### We can adjust the angular frequency $\\omega$ using a slider. The Mathlet reminds us that the period is given by $\\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$, so that large $\\omega$ means small period, and $\\omega = 1$ means period $2\\pi$. The angular frequency is measured in radians per second. The angular frequency determines the ***frequency***; it is $\\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}$, measured in cycles per second, or ***Hertz***. We will always prefer the angular frequency because it makes our formulas neater.\n",
    "\n",
    "### There are three \"system parameters\": the mass $m$, the damping constant $b$, and the spring constant $k$. The mass is fixed at $m=1$, but the other two can be adjusted using the sliders. Spend a few minutes now playing with this Javascript Mathlet. You can animate it with the [>>] key under the graphing window.\n",

In Lecture 2, we see that this example is a mechanical analogue of an extremely simple AM radio receiver, and the analysis we carry out determines important features of the radio, such as the frequency it is tuned to and how sharp the tuning is.\n",

    "## Modeling the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An important part of 18.031x, and of this course, is the process of modeling a mechanical or electrical system using ordinary differential equations. The basic process has the following steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Draw a diagram of the system.\n",
    "### 2. Identify and give symbols for the parameters of the system with units.\n",
    "### 3. Declare the input signal and the system response.\n",
    "### 4. Decide what you are looking for: a solution satisfying specific initial conditions or a steady state solution.\n",
    "### 5. Write down a differential equation relating the input signal and the system response, e.g. using Newton's \"$F = ma$\" in the mechanical case or Kirchhoff's laws in the electrical case.\n",
    "### 6. Rewrite the equation in standard form.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In our case:\n",
    "### 1. Here is a diagram of the system we are studying.\n",
    "![img](img/model.png)\n",
    "### 2. We have already named the relevant system parameters, on the diagram: $m$, $b$, and $k$. Note we now allow $m$ to take a value other than $1.0$.\n",
    "### 3. The input signal is given by the position of the dashpot piston; we will write $y(t)$ or just $y$ for this function of time. We have to declare also which is the positive direction for $y$: It's value increases when the piston moves up. The system response we are interested in is the position of the mass, which we will write $x(t)$. It's value also increases as the mass moves up. We also declare $x=0$ to be the position at which the spring is relaxed. Thus when $x>0$ the spring is compressed and exerts a force pointing down, while if $x<0$ it is extended and exerts a force pointing up.\n",
    "###    These declarations are arbitrary – we could instead make $y$ become positive when the piston moves ***down***, or say $x=1$ when the spring is relaxed. We would get the same analysis, but expressed somewhat differently. Specifying that the spring is relaxed when $x=0$ simplifies the expressions enough to make it a very good idea.\n",
    "### 4. We will assume that we are working in the linear regime. That is, we assume first that the force of the spring on the mass is proportional to $x$, i.e. $x$ is small enough that Hooke's law is valid. Second we assume that the force exerted by the dashpot on the mass is proportional to the speed so $\\dot{x}$ and $\\dot{y}$ are small enough that the damping effect of the dashpot is linear. Thus \"Hooke's law\" tells us – the force exerted by the spring is proportional to $x$. The force exerted on the mass by the dashpot is proportional to the speed at which the plunger is moving through the piston. The two proportionality constants are $k$ and $b$, so Newton's law gives us\n",
    "## $$ m\\ddot{x} = F = -kx-b(\\dot{x}-\\dot{y}) $$\n",
    "### 5. \"Standard form\" means: terms coming from the input signal on the right, and terms coming from the system response on the left. So we have:\n",
    "## $$ m\\ddot{x} + b\\dot{x} + kx = b\\dot{y} $$\n",
    "###    This is the differential equation relating the input signal $y$ and the system response $x$. It is valid whether the input signal is sinusoidal or not, and it allows for non-sinusoidal system responses.\n",
    "### - The model does reflect the assumptions that we could use linear force laws.\n",
    "### - In this modeling process we did not need to assume $m$, $b$, and $k$ were constant. But we will observe this system over a small enough time scale that we may assume that $m$, $b$, and $k$ are effectively constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Putting these two assumptions together we get a linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients.\n",
    "### A system exhibiting both these hypotheses is called a ***Linear time invariant*** or ***LTI*** system. This entire course revolves around understanding the behavior of LTI systems, based on an analysis of solutions of the corresponding \"LTI\" differential equations"

Hence we say that in this position, the spring is relaxed, and ignore the force of gravity.\n",

This has profound implications about the structure of the collection of system responses, generally captured by the statement of \"superposition.\" For example, if $x_1$ is a system response to the input signal $y_1$, and $x_2$ is a system response to the input signal $y_2$, then the input signal $a_1 y_1 + a_2 y_2$ (where $a_1$ and $a_2$ are constants) has as a response the linear combination $a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2$.\n",
