Now we can understand better why the convergence fails: it fails when you hit a pole. Generally, the region of convergence is the half-plane to the right of the rightmost pole.\n",

You will learn about this if you take a course in complex variables; the process is known as ***analytic continuation***.\n",

Their expression, as a quotient of one polynomial by another, allows computation of the values of the function for almost every complex number.
