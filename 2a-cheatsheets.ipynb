    "## L4.2. Recap and prospect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### There are a lot of remaining questions we'd like to answer about the behavior of systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "### - Can we use the transfer function to predict how the system will respond to other input signals?\n",
    "### - Suppose we have recorded the system response to a ***single*** (non-null) signal. Can we use that single response to determine the transfer function (and hence the system parameters)?\n",
    "### - How can we extend our methods to cover the behavior of more complicated systems involving feedback?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here we introduce the ***Laplace transform***, which is the machinery we use to answer these questions through the remainder of this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's recall where we are. We have developed some of the “linear, time-invariant\" theory of mechanical and electronic systems. A principal result of our work is an understanding of how such a system responds to an exponential input signal – one of the form $y(t) = e^{st}$ for a fixed complex number $s$. We found that there is generally a system response that is a multiple of the input signal\n",
    "## $$ x(t) = H(s) e^{st} $$\n",
    "### The “system function\" or “transfer function\" $H(s)$ depends upon the exponential constant $s$ (which is often a complex number) but is independent of $t$. The exception occurs when $s$ is a pole of $H(s)$; this condition is termed “resonance.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### This provides one particular system response to $e^{st}$. By superposition, the other solutions are given by adding in some homogeneous solution (response to the zero input signal). For this theory to be useful, the system must be ***stable***, i.e. all these signals must die off as $t$ gets large. We found that stability is equivalent to requiring all the poles of $H(s)$ to have negative real part, i.e. to lie in the left half plane. In this case, the null responses are “transients,\" and all system responses to the same input signal become asymptotic as $t$ grows large.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A second assumption we make in this course is that the system is controlled by a differential equation: one of the form\n",
    "## $$ P(D)x = Q(D)y $$\n",
    "### Then we found that\n",
    "## $$ H(s) = \\frac{Q(s)}{P(s)} $$\n",
    "### The transfer function thus contains, as coefficients, the system parameters characterizing the LTI system, as they enter into the differential equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### This is a beautiful theory, and by taking $s=i\\omega$ we obtain a complete understanding of how the system responds to sinusoidal signals; $H(i\\omega)$ is the ***complex gain*** $G(\\omega)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Throughout the rest of this course, we'll address the questions at the top. In this lecture, we introduce the machinery that will allow us to answer these questions."

    "\n",
