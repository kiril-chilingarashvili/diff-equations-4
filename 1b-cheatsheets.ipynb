    "\n",
    "### 2. ***Identify and give symbols for the parameters of the system***. The diagram shows symbols for four standard electronic components. The first step in understanding the diagram is to define an orientation; say that current flows clockwise. Since it's a series circuit, the current through any of the wires is the same; write $I(t)$ for it. Then we can say that the power source, at left, produces a voltage ***increase*** of $V(t)$ volts at time $t$. This voltage increase may vary with time, and may be negative as well as positive. In fact we'll be especially interested in the case in which it is sinusoidal!\n",

    "### 3. ***Declare the input signal and the system response***. The system is being driven by a signal coming in via antenna. This signal causes a voltage difference across the antenna, and it is reasonable to declare this voltage increase $V(t)$ as the input signal. For system response, we are interested in the loudness of the speaker, which is proportional to the voltage drop across the resistor. So we declare $V_R$ to be the system response.\n",

    "## Bode Plot - Footnotes\n",
    "\n",
    "### ***Why “Bode\"?*** \n",
    "#### Bode plots are named after Hendrick Wade Bode, 1905–1982. Bode (rhymes with toady) was one of the fathers of modern control theory. For most of his career he worked at Bell Labs. During World War II he devised the feedback mechanism linking radar data to anti-aircraft fire. After the war he occupied high administrative positions at Bell Labs. In 1967 he retired as Vice President in charge of military development and systems engineering, and took up the position of Gordon McKay Professor at Harvard, a post he held till 1974.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our use of the phrase “Bode plots\" in this course is inaccurate in several respects. First of all, in engineering applications one typically has to cope with a wide range of frequencies. To represent them, one plots the log of the frequency horizontally. Similarly, the gain often spans a wide range of values, and to provide clear visualizations of the gain it is sensible to plot  rather than . So typically the gain Bode plot uses a log-log scale, as shown below.\n",
    "![img](img/bode.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The vertical logarithmic scale is often measured in “decibels.\" The decibel measure of gain $g$ is $20 \\log_{10} g$ Db. This can also be written $10 \\log_{10} g^2$, which is of interest since the power of a sinusoidal signal is proportional to the square of its amplitude. Use of these units originated at Bell Labs in the 1920's.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The phase Bode plot uses $\\log \\omega$ horizontally, and $-\\phi$ vertically. No need for a log vertically; after all, in a sense $\\phi$ is already a logarithm – in the complex gain it occurs as $e^{-i\\phi}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Even these smooth log-log plots are not quite the thing that Bode introduced. He provided quick and efficient ways to sketch these plots, or piecewise linear approximations of them."
