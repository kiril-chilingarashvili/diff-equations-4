    "## L3.2. Poles of the transfer function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The transfer function formalism makes our notation neater, and broadens its scope: $s$ rather than $i\\omega$, and it gives information about more general system responses. But this generalization of $G(\\omega)$ is extremely useful in understanding the complex gain itself, as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The transfer function is a fairly complicated gadget. You can't really graph it! It takes a complex number as input, so its graph lies over the complex plane; and it produces a complex number as output, which needs another two dimensions to represent. So we can't graph it in three dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### But the most useful part of the complex gain is its magnitude – the gain. So instead of graphing $H(s)$, we will graph $|H(s)|$. This is now a surface lying over the complex plane. Let's do some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For a start, suppose our system is an undamped spring system, driven through the spring. This system is modeled by the equation\n",
    "## $$ m\\ddot{x}+kx = ky $$\n",
    "### This is the harmonic oscillator with natural frequency\n",
    "## $$ \\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} $$\n",
    "### It's expressed in standard form $P(D)x = Q(D)y$, with\n",
    "## $$ P(s) = ms^2+k, \\quad Q(s) = k $$\n",
    "### So, its transfer function is\n",
    "## $$ H(s) = \\frac{k}{ms^2+k} = \\frac{k/m}{s^2+k/m} = \\frac{\\omega_n^2}{s^2+\\omega_n^2} $$\n",
    "### Let's think first of the graph of\n",
    "## $$ g(\\omega) = |G(\\omega)| = |H(i\\omega)| = \\frac{\\omega_n^2}{|(i\\omega)^2+\\omega_n^2|} = \\frac{\\omega_n^2}{|\\omega_n^2-\\omega^2|} $$\n",
    "### When $\\omega = \\pm \\omega_n$, the denominator vanishes and $G(\\omega)$ isn't defined. This is resonance! When $\\omega$ is near to $\\pm \\omega_n$ but not quite equal to it, the value of the gain is large; the sinusoidal system response has amplitude much larger than the amplitude of the input signal. As $|\\omega|$ gets large, the gain falls off to zero. The graph looks like this:\n",
    "![img](img/resonance.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### This is the amplitude response curve of the system. Note that the frequency enters here only through its square. We lose nothing, and gain quite a bit, by formally allowing $\\omega$ to take on negative values as well as positive ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Now let's think about the absolute value of the full transfer function,\n",
    "## $$ |H(s)| = \\frac{\\omega_n^2}{|s^2+\\omega_n^2|} $$\n",
    " \n",
    "### The polynomial $s^2+\\omega_n^2$ has two roots, $s=\\pm i\\omega_n$. At these values of $s$, the transfer function is not defined. When $s$ is near to $\\pm i\\omega$, the value of $|H(s)|$ is large; when $|s|$ gets big, $|H(s)|$ falls off to small values. The graph looks like this:\n",

The most important features of the graph of $|H(s)|$ – and so of the gain curve – are captured by the location of the poles.

So if you walk this terrain on a path over the imaginary axis, starting from $i\\omega$ for $\\omega$ larger than the resonant frequency, you will climb up the shoulder of the mountain near $\\displaystyle -\\frac{b}{2}+i\\omega_d$; then descend to a valley that reaches a relative minimum at $\\omega=0$; and then goes through a symmetrical elevation gain and loss for negative $\\omega$.\n",
