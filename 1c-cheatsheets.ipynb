    "\n",
    "### The transfer function formalism makes our notation neater, and broadens its scope: $s$ rather than $i\\omega$, and it gives information about more general system responses. But this generalization of $G(\\omega)$ is extremely useful in understanding the complex gain itself, as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The transfer function is a fairly complicated gadget. You can't really graph it! It takes a complex number as input, so its graph lies over the complex plane; and it produces a complex number as output, which needs another two dimensions to represent. So we can't graph it in three dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### But the most useful part of the complex gain is its magnitude – the gain. So instead of graphing $H(s)$, we will graph $|H(s)|$. This is now a surface lying over the complex plane. Let's do some examples.\n",

    "### When $\\omega = \\pm \\omega_n$, the denominator vanishes and $G(\\omega)$ isn't defined. This is resonance! When $\\omega$ is near to $\\pm \\omega_n$ but not quite equal to it, the value of the gain is large; the sinusoidal system response has amplitude much larger than the amplitude of the input signal. As $|\\omega|$ gets large, the gain falls off to zero. The graph looks like this:\n",

    "### Note that when $i\\omega$ is near the zeros the gain is small. The poles were chosen to raise the gain as soon as $\\omega$ is outside the range $[2, 3]$. Because the number of zeros equals the number of poles the gain goes asymptotically to a non-zero value (in this case 1) as $\\omega$ gets large. The net result is a ***band-stop*** filter: any input with frequency in the frequency band $[2,3]$ is suppressed because the gain is near 0. Other frequencies are passed through because the gain is near 1.\n",
