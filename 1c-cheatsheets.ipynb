    "## L3.2. Poles of the transfer function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The transfer function formalism makes our notation neater, and broadens its scope: $s$ rather than $i\\omega$, and it gives information about more general system responses. But this generalization of $G(\\omega)$ is extremely useful in understanding the complex gain itself, as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The transfer function is a fairly complicated gadget. You can't really graph it! It takes a complex number as input, so its graph lies over the complex plane; and it produces a complex number as output, which needs another two dimensions to represent. So we can't graph it in three dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### But the most useful part of the complex gain is its magnitude – the gain. So instead of graphing $H(s)$, we will graph $|H(s)|$. This is now a surface lying over the complex plane. Let's do some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For a start, suppose our system is an undamped spring system, driven through the spring. This system is modeled by the equation\n",
    "## $$ m\\ddot{x}+kx = ky $$\n",
    "### This is the harmonic oscillator with natural frequency\n",
    "## $$ \\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} $$\n",
    "### It's expressed in standard form $P(D)x = Q(D)y$, with\n",
    "## $$ P(s) = ms^2+k, \\quad Q(s) = k $$\n",
    "### So, its transfer function is\n",
    "## $$ H(s) = \\frac{k}{ms^2+k} = \\frac{k/m}{s^2+k/m} = \\frac{\\omega_n^2}{s^2+\\omega_n^2} $$\n",
    "### Let's think first of the graph of\n",
    "## $$ g(\\omega) = |G(\\omega)| = |H(i\\omega)| = \\frac{\\omega_n^2}{|(i\\omega)^2+\\omega_n^2|} = \\frac{\\omega_n^2}{|\\omega_n^2-\\omega^2|} $$\n",
    "### When $\\omega = \\pm \\omega_n$, the denominator vanishes and $G(\\omega)$ isn't defined. This is resonance! When $\\omega$ is near to $\\pm \\omega_n$ but not quite equal to it, the value of the gain is large; the sinusoidal system response has amplitude much larger than the amplitude of the input signal. As $|\\omega|$ gets large, the gain falls off to zero. The graph looks like this:\n",
    "![img](img/resonance.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### This is the amplitude response curve of the system. Note that the frequency enters here only through its square. We lose nothing, and gain quite a bit, by formally allowing $\\omega$ to take on negative values as well as positive ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Now let's think about the absolute value of the full transfer function,\n",
    "## $$ |H(s)| = \\frac{\\omega_n^2}{|s^2+\\omega_n^2|} $$\n",
    " \n",
    "### The polynomial $s^2+\\omega_n^2$ has two roots, $s=\\pm\\omega_n$. At these values of $s$, the transfer function is not defined. When $s$ is near to $\\pm i\\omega$, the value of $|H(s)|$ is large; when $|s|$ gets big, $|H(s)|$ falls off to small values. The graph looks like this:\n",
    "![img](img/pole.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you slice the graph of  with a plane above the imaginary axis, you get the graph of the gain, which is the amplitude response curve – the graph of .\n",
    "\n",
    "I think of this graph as like a tent. The canvas is draped over two tall poles, one at , the other at . Do you agree?\n",
    "\n",
    "The points  are called poles, perhaps because they lie at the base of the tent-poles. The most important features of the graph of  – and so of the gain curve – are captured by the location of the poles. A diagram of the complex plane with the location of the poles marked by X 's is called a pole diagram of .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In our cases the poles of  are exactly the roots of the denominator,  (assuming  and  have no common factors).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what happens if we introduce some damping? Let's set  to save on symbols. So\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "The roots of  can be found by the quadratic formula, or, if you prefer, by completing the square:\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "so  is a root if . With  small (smaller than , the system is underdamped; the right hand side is negative; and the roots are\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "is the damped angular frequency. The roots have also acquired a real part that is negative. The damping has pushed them off the imaginary axis!\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of damping there is no pure resonance. Engineers call the frequency that produces the largest gain (at least if  is small relative to ) “practical resonance\". The amplitude response curve is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The transfer function is now\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "This function has poles at the roots of the denominator, that is, at . The pole diagram is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph of  exhibits two infinitely high peaks over these two points.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph of , poles no longer along imaginary axis\n",
    "\n",
    "These points are no longer on the imaginary axis, but, if  is small relative to , they are not far off. So if you walk this terrain on a path over the imaginary axis, starting from  for  larger than the resonant frequency, you will climb up the shoulder of the mountain near ; then descend to a valley that reaches a relative minimum at ; and then goes through a symmetrical elevation gain and loss for negative .\n",
    "\n",
    "This hiking imagery is very useful. It explains how poles influence the gain curve.\n",
